# Manual-Testing-Practice-3
Integration Testing and Bug Tracking for the implementation of Slack functionality with Salesforce.


1. What software or application are you testing & What does it do? 

I am testing my Salesforce Slack Integration application for my manual tests. This application integrates the functionalities of the Salesforce interface and Slack interface and allows the user to send Lead notifications that are performed in Salesforce directly to the Slack users in your organization. This can help ensure that users in your org receives notifications directly so they do not miss important or time sensitive updates.


2. What kind of test will you be using to Test your int? 

I will be performing Integration Testing. This ensures that when the Slack integration in Salesforce is executed, you can test each individually implemented module separately before testing them as a fully integrated unit.
